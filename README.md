Hiya, I'm Marv


Cybersecurity Engineer Â· Backend Developer Â· Network-curious


I build secure, reliable backend systems and hunt for weaknesses in apps and infrastructure. I like code thatâ€™s readable, auditable, and hard to exploit â€” and I keep things chill while shipping practical projects you can try.



What I do




Secure backend development (Node.js, Express, Python)


Application security & pentesting (OWASP-aware, secure coding)


Real-time systems & observability (Socket.IO, logging, alerting)


Getting into network engineering fundamentals (routing / CCNA study)





Tech & tools


Node.js â€¢ Express â€¢ Python â€¢ PostgreSQL â€¢ Prisma â€¢ Socket.IO â€¢ Git â€¢ Docker â€¢ Tailwind â€¢ Linux


Youâ€™ll usually find me switching between a debugger, a terminal, and a threat model.
